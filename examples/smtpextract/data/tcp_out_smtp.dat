* Added support for macros in the "default source code" (Tools/Editor =
Options/Code)
* Separated layout info from project file. It is now kept in a different =
file

you
  have your project under CVS control, you ''ll know why this had to =
happen...
* Compiler settings per-project
* Compiler set per-project

under Dev-C++.
* New class browser option: "Show inherited members"
* Added support for the '::' member access operator in code-completion

version 4.9.6.1
* New "Abort compilation" button
* Bug fixes
* Now checks for vRoach existance when sending a crash report

Version 4.9.5.5
* New option in Editor Options: Show editor hints. User can disable the =
hints
  displayed in the editor when the mouse moves over a word. Since this =
was the
  cause of many errors (although it should be fixed by now), we are =
giving the
  user the option to disable this feature.
* New option in Editor Options (code-completion): Use code-completion =
cache.
  Well, it adds caching to code-completion. Depending on the cache size,
  the program may take a bit longer to start-up, but provides very fast
  code-completion and the user has all the commands (belonging to the =
files
  he added in the cache) at his fingertips. If, for example, the user =
adds
  "windows.h", he gets all the WinAPI! If he adds "wx/wx.h", he gets all =
of
  wxWindows! You get the picture...
* Removed "Only show classes from current file" option in class browser =
settings.
  It used to be a checkbox, allowing only two states (on or off), but =
there is
  a third relevant option now: "Project classes" so it didn't fit the =
purpose...
  The user can define this in the class browser's context menu under =
"View mode".
* Fixed the dreaded "Clock skew detected" compiler warning!
* Fixed many class browser bugs, including some that had to do with =
class folders.

Version 4.9.5.4
* Under NT, 2000 and XP, user application data directory will be used to =
store config files (i.e : C:\Documents and Settings\Username\Local =
Settings\Application Data)

Version 4.9.5.3
* Added ExceptionsAnalyzer. If the devcpp.map file is in the devcpp.exe =
directory
  then we even get a stack trace in the bug report!
* Added new WebUpdate module (inactive temporarily).
* Added new code for code-completion caching of files (disabled - work =
in progress).

Version 4.9.5.2
* Added new option in class-browser: Use colors
  (available when right-clicking the class-browser
  and selecting "View mode").
* Dev-C++ now traps access violation of your programs (and of itself too =
;)

Version 4.9.5.1
* Implemented the "File/Export/Project to HTML" function.
* Added "Tip of the day" system.
* When running a source file in explorer, don't spawn new instance.
  Instead open the file in an already launched Dev-C++.
* Class-parser speed-up (50% to 85% improvement timed!!!)
* Many code-completion updates. Now takes into account context,
  class inheritance and visibility (shows items only from files
  #included directly or indirectly)!
* Caching of result set of code-completion for speed-up.
* New option "Execution/Parameters" (and "Debug/Parameters").

Version 4.9.5.0 (5.0 beta 5):
* CPU Window (still in development)
* ToDo  list
* Backtrace in debugging
* Run to cursor
* Folders in Project and Class Browser
* Send custom commands to GDB
* Makefile can now be customized.
* Modified the behaviour of the -c param :=20
  -c <config file directory>
* Saving of custom syntax parameter group
* Possibility of changing compilers and tools filename.
* Many bug fixes

* back to gcc 2.95.3
* Profiling support
* new update/packages checker (vUpdate)
* Lots of bugfixes
